## How Often Should You Clean Your Oven?

Most households should have their oven professionally cleaned at least once a year. However, if you cook frequently or use your oven for roasting and grilling, you may benefit from cleaning every six months.

### Signs Your Oven Needs Cleaning

- **Smoke when cooking** – Built-up grease and food residue can smoke and affect the taste of your food
- **Unpleasant smells** – Burnt-on food creates odours every time you use the oven
- **Visible grease and grime** – If you can see the build-up, it's definitely time
- **Oven door looks cloudy** – Grease between the glass panels needs professional attention
- **Uneven cooking** – Heavy residue can affect heat distribution

### The Benefits of Regular Cleaning

A clean oven isn't just more pleasant to use – it's also more efficient. Grease and carbon build-up can affect how evenly your oven heats, potentially leading to unevenly cooked food and higher energy bills.

Professional cleaning removes all traces of burnt-on food and grease, leaving your oven looking and working like new. At Sparkling Clean, we use non-caustic, fume-free products that are safe for your home and family.

## Is Professional Oven Cleaning Worth It?

In short: yes. While DIY oven cleaning products are readily available, professional cleaning delivers results that are difficult to achieve at home.

### What Professional Cleaning Includes

When you book with Sparkling Clean, we don't just wipe down the inside of your oven. We:

- Remove all racks, trays, and removable parts
- Soak components in our specialist cleaning tank
- Clean the oven interior, including hard-to-reach areas
- Clean the door glass, including between the panels
- Clean the hob and extractor hood if included
- Leave everything spotless and ready to use

### The DIY Challenge

Shop-bought oven cleaners can produce strong fumes and often contain caustic chemicals. They require significant scrubbing and rarely tackle the deeper grime that builds up over time.

Professional cleaning uses specialist equipment and products that aren't available to consumers. The results speak for themselves – most customers are amazed by the transformation.

### Value for Money

Consider the time you'd spend tackling your oven yourself, plus the cost of cleaning products. Now compare that to a professional clean that takes around an hour and leaves your oven looking factory-fresh.

For most families, professional oven cleaning represents excellent value for money. It's a small investment that makes a big difference to your kitchen.

## How to Keep Your Oven Cleaner for Longer

After a professional clean, you want to enjoy that sparkling oven for as long as possible. Here are our top tips for maintaining your oven between services.

### Wipe Up Spills Quickly

The single most effective thing you can do is wipe up spills while the oven is still warm (but not hot). Fresh spills are much easier to remove than burnt-on residue.

### Use Oven Liners

Placing a non-stick oven liner at the bottom of your oven catches drips and spills before they burn onto the surface. They're inexpensive and can be washed in the sink or dishwasher.

### Cover Food When Possible

Using lids, foil, or oven-safe covers reduces splashing and spitting, keeping your oven cleaner.

### Clean the Door Regularly

The oven door is easy to forget but quickly shows grease marks. A quick wipe with warm soapy water after use keeps it looking fresh.

### Don't Forget the Racks

Remove racks periodically and give them a good clean in hot soapy water. This prevents grease from building up and burning on.

### Schedule Regular Professional Cleans

Even with good maintenance, professional cleaning once or twice a year keeps your oven in peak condition. We remove the deep-seated grease and carbon that everyday cleaning can't tackle.

## Oven Cleaning for Tenants and Landlords

The oven is often the most scrutinised appliance during an end of tenancy inspection. Here's what you need to know about meeting the required standards.

### For Tenants: Protect Your Deposit

Most tenancy agreements require you to leave the property in the same condition as when you moved in. For the oven, this typically means a professional standard of cleanliness.

DIY cleaning rarely meets the expected standard, especially if the oven has been used regularly throughout your tenancy. Professional cleaning provides:

- A guaranteed standard of cleanliness
- Receipt as proof of professional cleaning
- Peace of mind during inspection

The cost of professional cleaning is almost always less than the potential deposit deduction for an unclean oven.

### For Landlords: Clear Expectations

Setting clear expectations about oven cleanliness helps avoid disputes:

- Include oven cleaning requirements in your tenancy agreement
- Document the oven's condition with photos at the start of each tenancy
- Recommend professional cleaning in your end of tenancy checklist
- Consider offering a list of approved cleaners (like us!)

### Our End of Tenancy Service

We work with both tenants and landlords across Dorset. We can often accommodate short-notice bookings for end of tenancy cleans, and we provide receipts suitable for deposit protection purposes.

## Range Cooker Cleaning Tips

Range cookers are a significant investment and a focal point of any kitchen. They also require more care than a standard oven. Here's our advice for keeping your range cooker in pristine condition.

### Why Range Cookers Need More Attention

Range cookers typically have:

- Multiple oven cavities
- Larger cooking surfaces
- More racks and accessories
- Complex controls and features
- Enamel or stainless steel finishes requiring specific care

This means more surfaces to clean and more places for grease to accumulate.

### Daily and Weekly Maintenance

**Daily:**
- Wipe down the hob after use
- Clean up any spills in the oven while still warm
- Wipe the control knobs and handles

**Weekly:**
- Clean the hob thoroughly, including around burners
- Wipe down the front of the cooker
- Check and clean any drip trays

### Professional Cleaning for Range Cookers

Given their size and complexity, range cookers particularly benefit from professional cleaning. We have experience with all major brands including Rangemaster, Falcon, Stoves, Smeg, and Mercury.

Our range cooker cleaning service includes:

- All oven cavities
- The hob and all burner components
- Oven racks and trays
- Door glass including between panels
- External surfaces

## BBQ Cleaning Before Summer

As the weather warms up, thoughts turn to outdoor cooking. But before you fire up the barbecue, there's an important question: when did you last clean it properly?

### Why BBQ Cleaning Matters

Barbecues accumulate grease, carbon, and food residue that can:

- **Affect taste** – Old, burnt-on residue imparts unpleasant flavours to fresh food
- **Create fire hazards** – Grease build-up can cause flare-ups
- **Harbour bacteria** – Food residue can contain harmful bacteria
- **Damage your BBQ** – Grease and carbon cause corrosion over time

A thorough clean at the start of the season ensures safe, delicious barbecue cooking.

### What We Clean

Our BBQ cleaning service covers:

- Grill grates and cooking surfaces
- Burners and heat diffusers
- Grease trays and drip pans
- Lid interior
- External surfaces

We remove all the built-up carbon and grease that makes your BBQ look neglected and affects your food.

### The Professional Difference

DIY BBQ cleaning with wire brushes can damage cooking surfaces and leave bristles that end up in your food – a genuine health hazard. Our professional cleaning uses appropriate tools and methods for each BBQ type.

### Book Early for Summer

BBQ cleaning bookings increase significantly as summer approaches. [Contact us now](/contact) to get your barbecue ready for the season.

Whether you have a compact kettle grill or a full outdoor kitchen, we can help your BBQ look and perform its best.
