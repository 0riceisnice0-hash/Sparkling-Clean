  {
    question: 'How long does an oven clean take?',
    answer: 'A single oven typically takes around 1 to 1.5 hours. Double ovens and range cookers take longer – usually 2 to 3 hours depending on size and condition. We\'ll give you a time estimate when you book.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do I need to be home during the clean?',
    answer: 'Yes, we recommend you\'re home while we work. However, you don\'t need to supervise – we\'ll work independently and keep any disruption to a minimum.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What products do you use?',
    answer: 'We use professional-grade, non-caustic cleaning products that are fume-free and safe for your home. They\'re effective on grease and grime but won\'t harm you, your family, or your pets.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can you clean the hob and extractor too?',
    answer: 'Yes! We clean hobs and extractor hoods as well as ovens. You can book these together for a complete kitchen appliance clean, or separately.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How often should I have my oven professionally cleaned?',
    answer: 'Most households benefit from a professional clean once or twice a year. If you cook frequently or do a lot of roasting and grilling, you might want to book more often.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you clean between the oven door glass?',
    answer: 'Yes! We dismantle the oven door (where possible) to clean between the glass panels. This removes that cloudy, dirty appearance that\'s impossible to reach normally.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Is there anything I need to prepare?',
    answer: 'Just make sure the oven has cooled down before we arrive. We\'ll handle everything else. It\'s helpful if the area around the oven is accessible.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What payment methods do you accept?',
    answer: 'We accept cash and bank transfer. Payment is due on completion of the work.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you offer discounts for regular bookings?',
    answer: 'Get in touch to discuss regular cleaning arrangements. We\'re happy to work out a schedule that suits you.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What areas do you cover?',
    answer: `We cover a wide area across Dorset, from Lymington to Poole. This includes Christchurch, Bournemouth, New Milton, Ringwood, Ferndown, Wimborne, and surrounding areas. Not sure if we cover your area? Give us a call.`,
  },
  {
    question: 'Can you do end of tenancy oven cleans?',
    answer: 'Absolutely. We work with both landlords and tenants to ensure ovens meet end of tenancy requirements. We provide receipts suitable for deposit protection purposes.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What if I need to cancel or reschedule?',
    answer: 'Please give us as much notice as possible if you need to change your booking. We understand that plans change – just get in touch and we\'ll rearrange.',
  },
